Counter-Strike Global Offensive - Gamestate Integration - Bombtimer Overlay
============
Counter-Strike Global Offensive - Gamestate Integration - Bombtimer Overlay
is a tool that uses the Valve **Gamestate Integration** technology to display
an overlay on your screen that shows the current state/time of the bombs timer.

**Note:** Since this is no memory hack or a hack in any way and uses Valve own technology
to communicate, on cannot be VAC banned. Theoretically. I DO NOT give a 100% guarantee!
Use at own risk!

Your help is valuable since this is a hobby project for all of us: we do development during out-of-office hours.

### Setup
* Copy all files to one folder, it doesn't matter where.
* Move the **gamestate_integration_nxnbombtimer.cfg** file to YOUR CS cfg folder, e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg
* Be sure you're playing at borderless fullscreen, fullscreen might not work.
* You're all set, run the exe and rock 'n' roll!
